# Tetris Created with Java

This report presents the results of my Java project, which was developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

There are a few key considerations that I have to keep in mind for next problems:

- Minimize the use of parameters in functions to maintain simplicity and readability.
- The most challenging aspect was fitting the pieces into some others that had the spaces. However, with time and persistence, I was able to find an efficient solution.


## Deployment and Repository

You can access the project's repository [here](https://github.com/felix-toledo/JAVA-tetris-oop-tdd).
The deployed results of the project can be found [here](https://felix-toledo.github.io/JAVA-tetris-oop-tdd/).


## Testing and Running the Java Code

1. Navigate to the `/src/main/java` directory to view the Java code.
2. Navigate to the `/src/test/java` directory to view the tests.
3. To run the tests, use the command `mvn test` in the terminal.
4. To compile and run the Java code, use the command `mvn compile exec:java` in the terminal.
